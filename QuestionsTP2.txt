Question 1: please write a small paper about that naming convention.

This naming convention is really useful to differenciate collections of ressources for exemple clients of a particular client

//

Question 2 : considering they use REST naming convention, what would do POST /web-api/users and POST /web-api/sessions endpoints?

The first operation will update the properties associated with a user. The second do the same with the sessions.

//

Question 4: How does Fastify behave in the following scenarios:

    If no JSON schema is provided for the body, query, or params?
    If the client submits an unknown property according to the JSON schema?
    If the client omits a required property according to the JSON schema?

If no JSON schema is provided for the body, query, or params, Fastify will not validate the request and it will pass through to the handler.

If the client submits an unknown property according to the JSON schema, Fastify will not validate the request and it will pass through to the handler.

If the client omits a required property according to the JSON schema, Fastify will return a 400 Bad Request error with a message describing the missing property.
